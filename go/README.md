# Go client for NebulaÂ Graph

This folder holds the Go client for Nebula Graph. The Go client communicates with the server through [fbthrift](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/).

> **DON'T:** Do not change the files under the `nebula/graph` directory because these codes are all generated by fbthrift.

## How to install

```shell
$ go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/go@master
```

If you get an error message like `cannot use path@version syntax in GOPATH mode`, see the instructions for [enabling go modules](#enabling-go-modules) below.

## How to use

For the usage example, see [Code Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/tree/master/go/example/graph_client_example.go).

## Enable the Go modules

Dependency management tools are built into go 1.11+ in the form of [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

If you are using go 1.11 or 1.12 and are working with a project located within `$GOPATH`, do the following step:

```sh
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Make sure that you define a `go.mod` file at the root of your project. If you do not have a `go.mod` file, run the following command to create one.

```sh

go mod init

```

Then get the dependencies of the Go client by running the following command:

```sh
go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-clients/go@master
```
